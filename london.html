            I've visited London twice, once in 2017 and again in 2023. During both trips I enjoyed exploring the city.
            Most notable were exploring Picadilly Circus in central London. Another highlight was walking the mall up to
            Buckingham palace to see the changing of the guard. I also enjoyed riding in the London Eye which offered
            stunning views of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster along the River Thames.
