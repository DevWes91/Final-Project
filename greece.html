            My trip to Greece in 2017 was one of my favorite international trips I've taken. My friends and I started in
            Athens, visiting the Acropolis and other ruins. From there we took a ferry to Santorini where we explored
            the beaches and rented a boat for a tour of the island. Our final stop was Mykonos island where we stayed
            for a full week. We enjoyed the beaches, restaurants, nightlife and natural beauty.
